Its a simple example of how graphQl works on nodeJs 
To start the program install bellow packages :
-"bcrypt": "^5.1.1",
-"body-parser": "^1.20.3",
-"express": "^4.21.2",
-"express-graphql": "^0.12.0",
-"graphql": "^15.10.1",
-"jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
-"mongoose": "^8.9.5"

For this project I use MongoDB as database on my local computer so you might set up your own mongoDB account to run the project
